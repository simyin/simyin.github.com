We've decided to go with GitHub and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki), using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for the backend of our company blog.
Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. Octopress is a framework for Jekyll that adds some rake scripts and themes that make getting started with Jekyll faster and easier. 
 
There were several factors that pushed us towards this decision as opposed to using [wordpress](http://wordpress.com/). I will list some of the advantages and disadvantages of each. [Click Here](#setup), if you want to skip this part and go straight to the setup instructions.

**Wordpress**

*Advantages*

1. Easy and quick to set up

2. Easy to find a suitable theme out of the box, or a freely available one created by a 3rd party.

3. Lot's of available plugins

*Disadvantages*

1. Slow (Potentially addressable with 3rd party caching plugins, but that adds additional overhead)

2. No backups

3. Embedding well formatted code requires 3rd party plugins

4. Uses an online WYSIWYG editor - some people might consider this a plus, but I find it much faster to use a nice markup language like markup inside an editor locally. I don't have to navigate to a webpage, navigate through the interface until I get to where I need to get and write inside a clunky WYSIWYG editor. 

5. I perceive Wordpress hosting as less reliable than GitHub's

**Jekyll/Octopress**

*Advantages*

1. Easy to set up, though less easy than wordpress

2. If you set it up on Github, you get automatic backup of your whole blog

3. Uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for markup. This makes the generated HTML much better and lighter than what can be generated by WYSIWYG editors, which are notorious for generating bad markup.

4. Much faster to post a blog post than Wordpress. All you have to do is run `rake new_post`, open the file with your editor, make changes and do `rake gen_deploy`. There is no need to navigate to a website, navigate through a web interface to open a WYSIWYG editor, wait for it to load and then post. Once you have the 3 main commands down, you are set.

5. You are in control

6. Jekyll generates static HTML pages - there is no need to deal with caching to make your blog fast. It already is. 

7. It's cool.

8. Easily customizable. Both Jekyll and Octopress are open source, you can easily customize them. I already made some changes to one of the Octopress rake files. It was pretty easy to find what I needed. 

9. From what I've seen so far, theming with Jekyll is very easy - certainly easier than Wordpress.

10. Very fast local preview using `rake preview`, so that you can preview your posts before publishing.

*Disadvantages*

1. It might be challenging to set up by non-geeks. Geeks should not have any problems (see advantages )

2. Not many plugins are available (Though there is less of a need for them)

3. Not many themes are available out of the box (see 9 in advantages)

**How to set up Jekyll/Octopress on Github**

1) Create an account on github.

2) There are two types of pages that you can create on github, one is User/Organization pages and the other is project pages. User pages will have a url of the form http://username.github.com while project pages have urls like: http://username.github.com/project. Of course you can also have multiple project pages, while you can have only one organization page. If you want to create an organization page, you have to create a repository named username.github.com. 

3) Next, we need to install octopress. The instructions here [http://octopress.org/docs/setup/](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) are pretty easy to follow. 

4) Deploy on github following the instructions here [http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/) Github supports 3 different protocols for pushing to the git repositories. I recommend using the ssh one, which has urls of the form: git@github.com:username/username.github.com.git. This [link here](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use) can give you more information on the differences between the different urls that Git supports.

If you get the following error when you deploy:

> 
    ##Pushing generated _deploy website
    Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly


That means you haven't setup your ssh correctly. More than likely, you need to add a ssh key to your .ssh folder. If you see an error message similar to access denied, then you probably haven't added the newly generated key to ssh: `ssh-add path/to/key`
[Here is some more information](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) on how to set up your ssh keys, so that github would allow you to commit to your repository. If you are still having trouble deploying, [these help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey) are great for troubleshooting ssh errors. 

Finally, don''t forget to setup the username and email to use for commits as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

Once you've followed the steps to generate the ssh key, it's a good idea to test if everything is working fine: 
``ssh -vT git@github.com``

After you've fixed your ssh troubles, `rake deploy` should work without issues and you should be able to see your page at http://username.github.com after a few minutes. Please note that it will take longer than usual for your pages to appear the first time you deploy,. 

Congratulations! Now, you are ready to start using your Jekyll blog. You can also take a look at some available Octopress themes [here](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes/)
